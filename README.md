# Scouting2017
FRC Scouting system for team 118 for the 2017 season

Notes before I start-\n
Clarify ratings (Driver, Overall, Bully, etc.)\n
Add category for tips/breaks/dead (robot failures)\n
Add stdev? (try to clarify averages somehow- bad matches have large impact)\n
Copy last years code if not already done\n
